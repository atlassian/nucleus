# Nucleus Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atlassian/nucleus.svg?branch=enable-travis)](https://travis-ci.org/atlassian/nucleus) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nucleus-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nucleus-server) ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-%20Ready%20for%20Awesome-red.svg)

A configurable and versatile update server for all your Electron apps

## Features

* Multiple applications
* Multiple channels for each application
* Companion publisher for [electron-forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge) to greatly simplify release publishing
* Backed by a static file store so minimal server costs
* One command to run so insanely simple to set up
* Platform Support:
  * macOS
  * Windows
  * Linux - RedHat

## Electron Version Requirements

Please note that using Nucleus requires that you use Electron `>=2.0.0`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:atlassian/nucleus.git nucleus-server
cd nucleus-server
cp config.template.js config.js
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will launch Nucleus running on your local machine with a local
file store and a SQLite database.

## Configuration

All the config options are thoroughly documented and explained in the
[config.template.js](config.template.js) file in this repository.

## Uploading Releases

Release uploading is explained inside Nucleus itself, for more advanced
information check out the [Uploading Docs](docs/Uploading.md).

## More Information

Please see the following documents for more information on Nucleus and how it works.

* [Internal Endpoints](docs/Endpoints.md)
* [Uploading Releases](docs/Uploading.md)
* [Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)

## FAQ

### Why does this use a static file store, why not use a traditional update server?

$$$, static file stores quite simply cost less to run than arrays of update servers

### Can I use CloudFront to speed up my downloads?

Yes, check out the CloudFront section of the S3 config inside [config.template.js](config.template.js).

### How do I switch to this from Update Server X?

Switching update servers in an Electron app is quite simple

1. Modify your autoUpdater code to point to this server (follow the instructions
on your app page inside Nucleus)
2. Release a new update for your application on your existing update server with this change
3. Release all future updates on Nucleus :)

### Is this really awesome?

Pretty sure it is :D

### How do I set this up in a production environment?

You can use the published version of this module `nucleus-server` which has
an exported CLI command (`nucleus`).  You then run the command with the first
argument being a path to your config file.  E.g.

```bash
NODE_ENV=production nucleus path/to/config.js
```

Please ensure you add redis session config and a proper (not local) authentication
method when running in a production environment.

To enable logging you need to set `DEBUG=nucleus*`.

## Development Requirements

* Node >= 8
* Yarn
* `createrepo` command, on linux you need to install this.  On macOS / Windows
  just ensure you have docker running and we'll spin up a docker container for
  `createrepo` to run from.
