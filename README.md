## Electron Version Requirements

Please note that using Nucleus requires that you use Electron `>=2.0.0`.

## Setup

### Docker

You'll need to set up your own docker image using a `Dockerfile` like below. (Make sure to modify `config.template.js` and save as `config.js`)

```
FROM atlassian/nucleus

COPY config.js /opt/service/config.js
```
Then **running your built docker image will run nucleus on port 3030.**

### Manual

1. Clone the repository with git clone.
2. Copy `config.template.js` to `config.js` in the current git directory.
3. Edit `config.js` to suit your needs.
4. Put your GPG public and private signing keys in `config.js` by following these steps:
5. Generate keys with empty passphrase with `gpg --full-generate-key`.
6. Run `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG` to see your key id. Example: **"rsa4096/C8E2A0E20C2AEB3B 2018-05-23 [...]"**, where **"C8E2A0E20C2AEB3B"** is your key ID.
7. Run `gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID` to get public key
8. Run `gpg --armor --export-private-key YOUR_KEY_ID` OR `gpg --armor --export-secret-key YOUR_KEY_ID` (whichever works) to get private key.
9. Paste the keys in the gpgSigningKey section in config.js like this (***enclosed in backticks, not single apostrophe***):
```
  gpgSigningKey: `
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

YOUR PUBLIC KEY CONTENTS

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

YOUR PRIVATE KEY CONTENTS

-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
`
};
```
10.Run yarn, followed by yarn dev
11. This will launch Nucleus running on your local machine with a local file store and a SQLite database.

## FAQ

### Why does this use a static file store, why not use a traditional update server?

$$$, static file stores quite simply cost less to run than arrays of update servers

### Can I use CloudFront to speed up my downloads?

Yes, check out the CloudFront section of the S3 config inside [config.template.js](config.template.js).

### How do I switch to this from Update Server X?

Switching update servers in an Electron app is quite simple

1. Modify your autoUpdater code to point to this server (follow the instructions
on your app page inside Nucleus)
2. Release a new update for your application on your existing update server with this change
3. Release all future updates on Nucleus :)

### Is this really awesome?

Pretty sure it is :D

### How do I set this up in a production environment?

You can use the published version of this module `nucleus-server` which has
an exported CLI command (`nucleus`).  You then run the command with the first
argument being a path to your config file.  E.g.

```bash
NODE_ENV=production nucleus path/to/config.js
```

Please ensure you add redis session config and a proper (not local) authentication
method when running in a production environment.

To enable logging you need to set `DEBUG=nucleus*`.

## System Requirements

* Node >= 8

  * `rpmsign`
  * `dpkg-scanpackages`
  * `dpkg-scansources`
  * `gpg`
  * `apt-ftparchive`
